# kcni-summer-school-day-3

To run the code for this tutorial, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/krembilneuroinformatics/kcni-school-lessons/tree/master/envs#kcni-school-envs) to run docker and clone the summer school repository. Then open your browser, navigate to your [local host](http://localhost:8787/), and you should be in `RStudio`.

Navigate to `day3` in `Rstudio's` file explorer, and run the `.Rmd` files. Everything should work from there.  

If you are experiencing issues with docker or would just like to follow along without using RStudio, the code and figures for each tutorial can be found below:
